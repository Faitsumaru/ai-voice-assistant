# **_Voice Assistant with Neural Networks (DialoGPT)_**

## About
This project demonstrates a voice assistant built using Python and powered by the DialoGPT neural network model for natural language processing.  
The assistant uses speech recognition to listen to user queries, processes them using the DialoGPT model, and generates spoken responses using text-to-speech synthesis.  
It is designed to handle conversational dialogue in English.
