# **_Voice Assistant with Neural Networks (DialoGPT)_**

## About
This project demonstrates a voice assistant built using Python and powered by the DialoGPT neural network model for natural language processing.  
The assistant uses speech recognition to listen to user queries, processes them using the DialoGPT model, and generates spoken responses using text-to-speech synthesis.  
It is designed to handle conversational dialogue in English.

### Key Features:
* **Speech Recognition** : Utilizes Google Speech-to-Text API for accurate English speech recognition.
* **Natural Language Processing** : Employs the DialoGPT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library for generating context-aware responses.
* **Text-to-Speech** : Uses `pyttsx3` for offline text-to-speech synthesis.
* **Context Awareness** : Maintains conversation history to provide coherent and contextually relevant responses.
* **Customizable** : Supports adjustments to voice, speed, and other parameters for a personalized experience.
* **Multimedia Integration** :
  * Searches for images using **Unsplash API**.
  * Finds videos on **YouTube** via YouTube Data API.
  * Plays local music files with playback controls (`play`, `pause`, `next`).
* **Mathematical Operations** : Performs simple arithmetic calculations.
* **Wikipedia Integration** : Provides summaries of topics using Wikipedia API.
